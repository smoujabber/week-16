# Tic-Tac-Toe description 

This game was created in week 16 of the MIT Full Stack Developer Program.
The goal of this project was to make a tic-tac-toe game online. 


## How to run
Get a friend and decide if your player O or X 
Then click on the square you'd like to make your X or O mark on 
The first player to get three in a row wins! 
Refresh the page to restart the game 

## Roadmap of future improvements
I think it would be great to add a picture icon for player X & O. It would make it more user friendly, I would also like to 
add a restart game button.
